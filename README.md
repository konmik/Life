My studen't work.
The task was to create the smallest possible code for implementation of "Conway's Life" game.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life

This game took the first place in my university with 109 bytes of compiled program (year 1997).

Control: left, up, right, bottom arrows to move, space to put or remove a cell.
It is supposed to run on MS DOS.
